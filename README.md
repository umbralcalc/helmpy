# helmpy - individual-based simulation of helminth transmission in a human population  

An all-in-one python class for forecasting the effects of 

1. mass drug administration,
2. infected human migration between separate sites,
3. and systematic individual non-compliance to treatment 

on helminth (parasitic worm) disease transmission for variable population sizes. 

The code runs with an optimised stochastic simulation method where best results can be attained through only a minimal (typically ~10, depending on the overall population number) number of repeat runs.

## Getting started

To fork, simply type into the terminal:

> git clone https://github.com/umbralcalc/helmpy.git

In the `/scripts` directory there is an ipython notebook with a worked examples for easy implementation.
