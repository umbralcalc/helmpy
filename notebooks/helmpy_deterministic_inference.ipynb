    "## 1. Theoretical background\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we outline the basic theoretical background for performing Bayesian parameter inference using mean field helminth models under the assumption that the system is in a state of endemic equilibrium. For helminth transmission parameter inference out of equilibrium, it is not recommended that mean field models are used for many of the reasons outlined in [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.17.19013490v1] - in such instances, the stochastic inference method is recommended, though it is more computationally expensive. Bear in mind, also, that inference with the mean field model will typically underestimate the variance of the posterior over parameters in comparison to inference with the stochastic model and so it should be used when population sizes are larger so that this additional variance is minimised.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formalism we will outline here assumes that the diagnostic data are either Kato-Katz counts (for _Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Schistosoma mansoni_ and hookworm diagnostic testing) or urine filtration counts (for _Schistosoma haematobium_ diagnostic testing). As ever in any canonical Bayesian problem, specification of the likelihood function ${\\cal L}$ is not the end of the story. To infer a joint posterior distribution ${\\cal P}$ given a dataset ${\\cal D}$ over the collection of transmission parameters $\\{ \\Lambda (a),k,z\\}$, Bayes' rule here reads \n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\cal P}[ \\Lambda (a),k,z \\vert {\\cal D}] = \\frac{1}{{\\cal E}} \\pi [\\Lambda (a)] \\, \\pi (k) \\, \\pi (z) \\,{\\cal L}[{\\cal D}\\vert \\Lambda (a),k,z] \\,,$$\n",

Kato-katz and urine filtration counts typically follow a distribution which appears to be negative binomial in shape. By computing the mean diagnostically-detected egg count $\\hat{{\\sf e}}_{\\rm d}$ from the transmission parameters $\\{ M (a),k,z\\}$, the likelihood distribution which will be used for the inference of these parameters is therefore likely to be well-approximated by\n",

In fact, one must consider the transmission dynamics to map between values of $\\Lambda (a)$ and $M(a)$.
